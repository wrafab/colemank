<H3> Week 2 | Fusion 360 and Design</h3>
<p> 
	For the first true project in our Digital Fabrication course, us students were given the opportunity to create objects using Comuter-Aided Design and 3D printers.  We were given a small list of options for ideas, or we could make whatever we wanted!  I chose to make a phone case, which was not as easy as I thought that it would be.
The first difficulty I experienced with this project was as simple as trying to figure out the design software, Fusion 360.  I had to mess around with the software by seeing the functions and tools that it had befor I made any progress on my phone case design.  With the help of my teacher and my own trial and error, I was eventually able to
get my phone case design underway.  The second issue I encountered, was taking the dimensions from my phone, and using those to create the dimensions for my case.  As this might seem like an easy task, it wasn't.  Since I have the iPhone X, my phone is extremely hard to figure out the correct dimensions when basing a phone case off of a rectangular
shape.  I also had to account for the thickness of the case, and how biug I would need to make it for it to fit my phone.  One of the last issues that I had during this project was figuring out the correct allignment for phone featurees such as the camera, power button, and voluume buttons.  I searched everywhere for the dimensions of the camera,
or how far away the power button is from the top of the phone, but I had no results.  So using what I had created of my case so far, I had to use that to make an educated guess on where I should put holes for the camera, power button, volume button, and charger.  Overall, I found this project to be a great way to introduce my classmates and I to
CAD!  I felt that I learned a lot and would love to create more objects using Fusion 360 and a 3D printer.
