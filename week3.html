<H3> Week 3 | Garment & Sublimation Printing</h3>
<p> 
Following our tasks of 3d printing, we were thr introduced to photoshop and had to create using those skills.  Wiht this unit, the first  task we had was to create a design using AdopePhotoshop to create a personalized image that would end up on a t-shirt.
I found this first tep the most difficult as I was unfamiliar with this application, and also struggled with simply coming up with what design I would be able to make and put on a t-shirt.  I then decided to make an original design of my favorite rapper, A$AP Rocky.
I didn't use just a single image of him, but rather made an original collage of many different pictures which personalized the design.  Once that was finished, I was ready to print, and the rest of the process was really easy.  Now that I know how to do everything
involved in making a shirt, I definitely will be doing it more!  After the t-shirt, we had a second assignment of sublimation printing, which I have never heard of until this class.  With this, you are able to make a personalized anything!  Some options include basketball
hoops, ties, socks, keychains, mugs, and so much more.  I decided to make a design for a mug because I didn't have one in my dorm room.  After creating the image I wanted on the mug, I then had to downnload a template so that I had the right dimensions when exporting
onto the flashdrive.  After that I was ready to print.  The machine prints out special images on certain paper that bonds to an object when heated.  It was super cool and something I have never seen before, so I'm really glad I had the opportunity to use that machine!  
It's crazy what kinds of things you can make on it.
