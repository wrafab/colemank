<H3> Week 8 | Soldering and Electronics</h3>
<p> 
 	The assignment for this rotation was to create circut boards using soldering.  We were given kits and had to follow instructions and get the kit to work using soldering.  I'm not really sure how to accurately explain what soldering is, but basically
you melt a wire with a really hot pen-like thing, which was really fun.  You had to solder the wires to the board, and you had to place each piece from the kit very precisely.  I was able to get two kits to work, which was really cool.  To connect with the whole
idea of getting a circut board to work, we also made some simple electronic circuts.  I was able to successfully create a few of those.  There were so many options of wwhat you could make using a sinple bread board and little pieces and wires.  It was tough to get
the hang of at first, but as soon as I got it, it was something that I really enjoyed.
