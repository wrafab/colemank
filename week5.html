<H3> Week 5 | 3d Printing </h3>
<p> 
For this rotation of the class, we were able to work with fusion 360 and the 3d printer and Fusion360 once again.  After learning from my errors in the earlier weeks, I had an easier time creating things.  One of the things that I was able to
create was a bust of my head.  I created this by taking a 3d scan of my face, and uploading that and a file of a pedestal to meshmixer.  There, I combined the pedestal and the bust of my head to create a stand for my head.  I found this process
super cool, as I saw how many things that could be made using a 3d scanner!  I derfinitely want to explore into more creations that cn be made with that.  However, the major difficulty that I experienced when creating this was scanning my head and
face.  You had to remain still during the scan, which was kind of hard for the first few times.  Other errors that were made were due to the person taking the scan, as they missed various parts of my head.  The second item that I created was a
something more functional.  I craeted a cup using my 3d printer that has so many uses! I currently use it to hold my makeup brushes, but it can also hold toothbrushes, pens and pencils, and other small objects such as coins.  With this, I didn't
have too much difficulty as I was more comfortable with designing on Fusion360.
