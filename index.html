        <h1>Week One</h1>
        <p>This was a fun one! First, I collected, sorted, and sanded eight different pieces of thin wood. I spray painted the board (admittedly, I should have waited until after I formed the board). The next step was forming the board. I used wood glue to quickly glue each piece of wood in a stack. Then, I placed the wood inside a clear plastic bag, on top of a styrafoam mold in the shape of a skateboard. I used a plastic pump to suck all the air out of the bag, and, magically, the wood formed into the right shape. It sat for 24 hours. The next day I took the board out and assessed the damage. It had formed well, but the wood glue had stained my beautiful deck!

            <br> Not too worry, I thought. I used the scrubbing power of walnut shells from the soap at the CTIC sink to rub off quite a bit of the glue. Next, I darkened the black and added some dope white stripes. Finally, I stamped my "CAMPANELLI" stamp (see <a href="#stamp">Rubber Stamp</a>) on the bottom. Next was the laquer. I put more than 4 coats on the bottom, which gave it a mirror like shinyness that looks spectacular. I'm planning to add grip tape to the other side, and then mount it on my wall at home.</p>

        <h1>Week Two</h1>
        <p>We were given a kit, and we had to solder! Mine was a little Simon Says game.

        <h1>Week 3</h1>
        <p>Our next assignment was to make cool stuff happen with an Arduino Uno microcontroller. I modified code on the blinking light project to make it blink long and short like morse code.

            <br> This is designed to run LEDs from an onboard arduino that light up when planes land at each of the airports.</p>

        <h1>Week 5</h1>
        <p>The first step was to model. I used meshmixer to cut my face off of the 3D scan from the <a href="#head">3D printed head project</a>. I then sent the file to Mr. Gerber, who milled it for me. Here is the final mill after about 8 hours of fun:

            <br> Next I mixed and poured silicone to make a mold. Finally, I poured liquid chocolate and enjoyed a narcissistic snack.

        <h1>Week 6</h1>
        <p>Next in line of my seemingly narcissistic projects was printing out stickers of my face. I photoshopped my face, and printed out stickers.

        <h1>Week 7</h1>
        <h3>It turned out great.</h3>
        <p>First, <a href="../valentines">Spenser</a> scanned my head with a cool device (I don't know the official name) which is an iPad with a Kinect on the back (it's a little more complicated than this, and has less brand names). It uses lasers, cameras, and a little magic and after someone walks around you with the scanner, out pops a 3D model! Next, I had to touch up a few holes on the top of my head where I wasn't able to be scanned. Then I printed it! It took a little less than an hour to print from heating to the final layer. After that, I tried a new 3d print finish to make it shiny. Here is the final product:

        <h1>Week 8</h1>
        <h3>It was S'well</h3>
        <p>I decided to bite the bullet and laser engrave my <a src="http://www.swellbottle.com/">S'well</a>, instead of using one of the bottles available. When using the rotary attatchment, all designs must be turned sideways, because of the way the rotorary turns the objects. I measured the bottle correctly, but for some reason, the text engraved slightly lower than I would have liked by a few millimeters. This is much better than the bottle breaking or the laser cutter burning a hole in the ceiling.

        <h1>Week 9</h1>
        <p>I made a rubber stamp with my last name on it. It was as easy as changing a few settings on the laser cutter. Here's what it looks like:

        <h1>Week 10</h1>
        <h3>Sad news</h3>
        <p>So, between now and the last time I posted, Fusion 360 decided to revert my Raspberry Pi Case CAD files to an older, broken version. :( It's too bad, but these things happen.</p>

        <h1>C-Squad Basketball Jersey</h1>
        <h3>Get hyped</h3>
        <p>Last year, I played team basketball for the first time in years. I was placed on the C-Squad team. On C-Squad, we never played other schools. Instead, we split up into smaller teams and had multiple seasons in which we played each other. I became known for my orange Nike Hyperdunk 2014's and my three pointers. I made a jersey with an ðŸ‘Œ emoji that I photoshopped to the same colors as my shoes. Then, on the back, I wrote my name and the number three in the orange colors I used on the ðŸ‘Œ. <img src="shirt.JPG"></p>

        <h1>Raspberry Pi Case Challenge: Part 1</h1>
        <h3>The design</h3>
        <p>The challenge: make a case for the Raspberry Pi 2B. Materials: Fusion 360 modeling software, a Raspberry Pi 2B, and digital calipers. Instead of making a case with a lid, I made more of a display case/bowl idea where the Pi board sits in the case with nothing on top. Here are pictures of the final design. <img src="case1.JPG"> <img src="case2.JPG"> Next week I will print it out! Stay tuned to see if my design worked!</p>

        <h1>Marshmallow Design Challenge</h1>
        <h3>Wir haben gewonnen.</h3>
        <p>The challenge: build the tallest tower possible with only a pack of spaghetti, a piece of string, tape, and a marshmallow (must be on the top). The team: me, <a href="../majewskis">Steven</a>, and <a href="../randazzoa">Alex</a>. We started by building a square base with four vertical pieces of spaghetti. <img src="mmdc.JPG"> On top of that, we placed a second square with four more vertical noodles. These pieces were connected to four more, one on each, and then met at the marshmallow. We ended up winning the challenge!</p>

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h3>A paragraph.</h3>
        <p>Hi! My name is Kendall Coleman. I'm a student at Western Reserve Academy, where I play field hockey, build model bridges, work in the Admissions and Technology offices, play drums, and represent my class on student council. Outside of WRA, I make websites and apps, enjoy Chipotle, spend way too much time on social media, and curate tasteful Spotify playlists. On this website, I will <del>chronicle the adventures</del> explain all the fun projects I've made for Mr. Gerber's Digital Engineering and Fabrication course.</p>
