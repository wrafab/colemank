<H3> Week 6 | Vinyl & Casting </h3>
<p> 
	The assignment for this rotation was to create stickers using the vinyl printer.  I wanted to create a sticker that would go on my computer.  Initially, I struggle to figure out what exactly I wanted the sticker to be.  Most of the time when I would create stuff, it took me the longest
to figure out what I wanted to do.  I then decided to print something with the logo from one of my favorite clothing brands.  I then had trouble figuring out how to get the sticker cut where I would want it, but it eventually worked out.  This was one of the more difficult rotations for me as I
had the most trouble figuring out what to make and understanding the software to make the things I wanted.  Overall, this was something very interesting to learn and I would like to use my knowledge to make some things like this in the future!
