<H3> Week 4 | Lazer Cutting and Engraving</h3>
<p> 
	The assignment this week was to create various things using CorelDraw to create various things using a laser printer.  One of the assignments was to build a makers box, which I created and put the faces of some of my favorite rappers on each side of the cube.  Another assignment was
to create and cut multiple different shapes that fit together using the lazer printer.  There were other things that we were able to do using the laser printer, such as engraving rubber braceletes, leather bookmarks, coasters, and glasses.  One of the most challenging things for me during this
rotation was simply figuring out what I wanted to create or put on the project.  Another thing that was difficult was also figuring out how to use the laser printer.  Initially, I had no idea how to choose the right settings, but after some practice, it became super easy and I loved making
and creating projects that included the laser printer.  I definitely wish this was something that we spent more time on doing, becuase there are a lot of cool things that you are able to make, yet I didn't have enough time to explore all the possibilites.  Overall, I really enjoyed this section
of the Digital Fab class and could find myself using this machine to create some things in the future!
