<H3> Week 7 | Vaccum formation</h3>
<p> 
	The assingment for this rotation was to create a skateboard.  We had to add an original unique design and create the skate board from scratch.  To make these, we each had 7 thin pieces of wood to glue together to form the skateboard.  If you wanted to put a laser design on the skaeboard, you had to do that first.  I chose to construct my skateboard first.  I had 
to work with a partner to create it, becuase you had to pour and roll the glue very quickly and then put on the next thin layer of wood.  It was very challenging doing this, as you and your partner had to work quickly to build the board.  Then when that was complete, we put the board on a mold, taped it, and then put it in a vaccum seal bag.  Finally you had to pump out
all the air, which gives the board its shape.  After this, you wait about a day and your board is almost complete.  The next task with this was to make it original.  I decided to spray paint some cool design on it, which made it my own unique board.  This was definitely one of the sections I enjoyed the most, who knew I could actually build my own skateboard!
